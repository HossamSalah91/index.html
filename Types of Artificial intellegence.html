    <td>The basic types of AI systems are considered fully interactive,
      as they do not have the ability to form memories, nor do they
      have the ability to use past experiences to inform current
      decisions. Deep Blue is the ideal model for this type of machine or device.
      IBM's chess-playing supercomputer, which beat international defender Garry Kasparov in the late 1990s.

      This section of AI includes machines that can look into the past. Examples of AI machines with limited memory range from chatbots in instant messaging and other apps, and virtual assistants in smartphones, to self-driving cars. Whereas these self-driving cars, for example, can observe the speed and direction of other cars, but they cannot do so in one moment, rather it requires identifying and monitoring specific things over time, and then these observations are added to the pre-programmed representations of the world , which also includes lane markings, traffic lights, and other important elements, such as curves in the road you're on.

    </td>
    <td>The third type of artificial intelligence is the theory of mind, unlike the two types of artificial intelligence (Reactive Machines) and Limited Memory Machines, which have widespread applications, systems based on theory of mind are still in the process of development. We stop here, and call this point the important gap between the machines we have and the machines we will build in the future, however, and it is better to be more precise in discussing the kinds of sims we want to form, and what they need to be.</td>
    <td>This is the important stage in the development of artificial intelligence systems, which is self-awareness as one of the types of artificial intelligence. Self-aware artificial intelligence has reached a limit so close to the human brain that it can be aware of its existence and develop self-awareness.</td>
