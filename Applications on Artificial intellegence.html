  1- Social media:

  The elements of artificial intelligence are present in many of the popular social media platforms that we use every day, such as Facebook! Facebook uses a proprietary algorithm to display content and ads that match your interests, from ranking and displaying posts on your homepage to predictions about your interaction with each one.
  
  Artificial intelligence includes many other features on the Facebook platform such as the image recognition system powered by machine learning, a system that recognizes your friends' photos and allows you to share memories with them. Facebook launched this feature in 2014, as Facebook beat the FBI in facial recognition, with an accuracy level of 97%, compared to an accuracy level of 85% at the FBI according to The Verge, an American news site operated by Vox Media.
  
  Most social media platforms allow users to express themselves and connect with others, but is there a downside?
  
  Although many are concerned about the widespread use of technology platforms and how this has facilitated some by hiding behind their digital screen and writing malicious comments; Exposing many to cyberbullying, Facebook's artificial intelligence also contributes to solving this problem, as it helps to identify and remove hate speech on a large scale without any human intervention. This is made possible by developing an understanding of language and different types of content, so that Facebook's systems can holistically analyze images, text, and comments.
  
  2- Determine your destination and know the expected time of arrival:
  
  Using Google Maps to guide us on our trips, or to check how long a road takes may seem like a simple process that takes just a few seconds, but in reality there is a lot of technology behind the scenes.
  
  The app uses machine learning to make predictions based on a comparison of two sets of data; Current data and past trips, the app analyzes past patterns and combines them with current traffic conditions. Based on this data, Google Maps can determine the expected time of arrival.
  
  To increase the level of accuracy, Google Maps has partnered with DeepMind, an AI-powered alphabetic research lab that uses a machine learning architecture known as Graph Neural Networks that enables it to better predict road conditions before any users are even affected by road congestion.
  
   Among the other advantages of artificial intelligence in this case is the ability to identify alternative routes to choose which way the user can walk to avoid traffic congestion. Predictive traffic models are determined in part by two types of data: Official data from local governments and instant feedback from users.
  
  3- Find a car for your trip:
  AI in our Daily Lives
  From helping us get to our destination to enabling us to book our flights, we can see the impact of AI in our daily lives wonderfully.
  
  A taxi-ordering service like Uber uses machine learning predictions to fill in the demand gap by using recorded data to estimate when orders will increase, and to provide a number of cars to cover those areas, and this helps Uber to retain customers, as users are more likely to turn to another service. If they do not have a car immediately.
  
  AI has also enhanced this experience by making it easy to communicate as it is difficult for drivers to type messages while driving; Natural language processing powered by machine learning gave drivers a one-click chat solution; Choosing from specific answers to the most common messages.
  
  4- Improving customer experience through chatbots
  How many times have you talked to a chatbot on a website to buy a product or get a specific service?
  
  
  Many companies have invested in artificial intelligence and chatbots specifically over the past few years, enhancing customer service and changing the way we receive our services.
  
  To facilitate and develop the customer experience, companies use chatbots to handle the initial steps of interaction with the customer, requesting basic information such as user account number, order number, payment details and contact information. This reduces the load on human resources and allows them to focus on issues that are complex for chatbots, as well as the wait time customers take to speak with agents – increasing the overall efficiency of the customer experience.
  
  AI-powered chatbots also help companies anticipate and avoid complaints by picking up patterns in user behavior and “learning” from them. This allows chatbots to notice problems and take control of them before they appear to the customer.
  
  5- Organize your inbox on your email
  
  Did you know that with your Gmail account, you deal with artificial intelligence on a daily basis without even noticing it?
  
  Gmail using AI in daily life
  To help you prioritize and organize your messages, Google uses artificial intelligence in Gmail to sort email messages into different categories such as primary, social, promotions, updates, forums, and spam. Artificial intelligence can remove 99% of unwanted emails. Gmail can also provide short smart responses using machine learning technology that makes your email reply a click away.
  
  With continued investment in AI, we can expect to see further growth in the coming years; As the uses of AI in daily life will become more and more impressive, even major organizations today are looking to AI to solve the major challenges facing us all.
